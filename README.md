## Can I Use My Metro Gift Card for Online Shopping?
A Metro Gift Card is a convenient and flexible way to shop at Metro stores, but if you're wondering whether you can use it for online purchases, you may be disappointed to know that it currently cannot be used for online shopping.

## What to Do If My Metro Gift Card Is Lost or Stolen?
A Metro Gift Card is a convenient way to shop for groceries and essentials at Metro stores. However, losing your gift card or having it stolen can be frustrating. Unlike debit or credit cards, gift cards are often treated like cash, meaning they may not always be replaceable. Here‚Äôs what you can do if your Metro Gift Card is lost or stolen.
1. Contact Metro Customer Service Immediately
If you realize your Metro Gift Card is missing, contact Metro‚Äôs customer service as soon as possible. Provide them with any details you have, such as the purchase receipt, card number, or any other identifying information. Some stores may be able to freeze or replace the balance if you have proof of purchase.
2. Check for Unauthorized Transactions
If you suspect that your lost or stolen **Metro Gift Card** has been used, ask customer service to check the transaction history. If unauthorized purchases have been made, Metro may not be able to refund the lost balance, as gift cards are often considered non-replaceable once used.
3. Keep Your Receipt for Future Protection
When purchasing a Metro Gift Card, always keep the receipt. The receipt often contains the card number, which may be useful if you need to report the loss. Some retailers may issue a replacement card if you have the original purchase proof.
4. Consider Using the Balance Quickly
To avoid the risk of losing your card, consider using the gift card balance sooner rather than later. The longer you wait, the higher the risk of misplacing it.
Losing a Metro Gift Card can be stressful, but acting quickly and keeping receipts can increase the chances of recovering your balance.
